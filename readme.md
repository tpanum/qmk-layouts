# Personal QMK Based Layouts
My layout is based on the colemak layout by [Ryan Prince (@judascleric)](https://github.com/judascleric), with slight modifications.

* The [Ergodox folder](tmk/) contains firmware for Ergodox.
* The [Kinesis folder](kinesis/) contains firmware for Kinesis Advantage with Stapelberg mod.
